	READ ME -- Example 4-UV_Spectrum_Summer

This example consists of a variation of Example 2.

A UV spectrum is generated for an air mass of 1.2 at an elevated site at 
34 deg. latitude (instead of 35.1). The same summer atmosphere is used (20 deg. 
temperature, 30% rel. humidity), but a default humidity-dependent aerosol model 
is now selected (Shettle & Fenn's rural aerosol).
The UV irradiance is calculated on a receiver tilted 34 deg. towards South 
(i.e., tilt = latitude). 
This geometry is such that near normal incidence is reached at the equinoxes. 
(Because air mass 1.2 corresponds to a zenith angle of 33.59 deg., the 
incidence angle at solar noon on equinox days will be 0.41 deg.)

The ozone column is now 0.3 atm-cm (300 DU) with no altitude correction.
