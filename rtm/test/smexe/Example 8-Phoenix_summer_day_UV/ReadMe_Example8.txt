	READ ME -- Example 8-Phoenix_summer_day_UVThis Example is similar to Example 7 but demonstrates the daily calculation feature. Like in Example 7, the selected site is Phoenix, Arizona (latitude 33.433N).Calculations will be done for August. The program will select the representative day for this month so that the daily irradiation predicted would be the average for the month if all atmospheric conditions remained constant and no clouds were present.The same calculation will be repeated with two different time steps (60 and 30 min). The UV irradiance is calculated on a receiver tilted 34 deg. towards South(i.e., tilt = latitude). This geometry is such that near normal incidence is reached at the equinoxes.All gaseous abundances are defaulted from the reference atmosphere selected (MLS), but the PRISTINE atmosphere option will modify some of them. A "Light soil" zonal albedo and a "Light sand" foreground are selected.
