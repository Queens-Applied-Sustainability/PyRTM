	READ ME -- Example 2-Arizona_UV_spectroradiometerThis example illustrates how to simulate a fictitious experiment of material degradation caused by UV, as monitored at a site close to Flagstaff, Arizona (lat. 35.1N, alt. 2.1 km amsl), in a dry, desert-like environment.The studied samples are installed on a tracking surface, facing a sandy foreground.The virtual experiment is monitored with a tracking spectroradiometer measuring global radiation, and a similar instrument measuring direct beam radiation within a 3 deg. half acceptance angle. Both instruments' FWHM is 1.2 nm, their spectral response with wavelength is close to Gaussian, their useful spectral range is 290-400 nm, and they output results at every nm from 290 nm.The conditions for this summertime experiment are known: Tair = 20 deg. C (during experiments), T = 15 deg. C (daily average), and RH = 30%.The ozone column at sea level is estimated at 0.3 atm-cm (300 Dobson units) from climatological data.The atmosphere is relatively dust-free and free of pollution. The type of aerosol is not known, but is probably close to a rural model.It is asked to compare the measured and predicted spectra at air masses 1.2 and 1.5, and also to extrapolate them to a zenith sun (air mass 1.0).The measured UV doses from a Robertson-Berger sensor and other UV radiometers are also to be compared to their predicted counterparts.
