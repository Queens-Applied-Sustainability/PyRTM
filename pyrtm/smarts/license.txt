This copy of the SMARTS (Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of
Sunshine) program package (hereafter, the Program) is provided free of charge to
the User under the conditions that:

 1. The User recognizes that the Program is the intellectual property of its
    Author, Dr. Christian A. Gueymard.
